# Node.js - Cadastro v1.2
## My first Node.js project

This is my first Node.js project and I will keep improving it with different functions and tools. This project is based in a real job test and the goal is to learn all the requirements and use the knowledge in this project

- Search address, neighborhood, city and state after inserting zip code 
- Create a new user
- Retrieve an user using the id

## Tech

Currently this project is coded with the following tech:

- [Node.js]

- [Git]
- [EJS]

## Modules

The modules installed were:

    axios 0.21.1

    dotenv 10.0.0
    ejs 3.1.6
    express 4.17.1

## Fixes and Other upgrades
- All message text are in portuguese
- Responsive layout
- All data fields are stored and showed properly
- Cleaner code

## Observations
The folder 0-old_html is where I'm storing all the layout using simple html before coding the .ejs files. I think it is important to keep this folder because it is my first time using .ejs and if I have any doubt in the future I can compare with the files I'm more used to code.
